**Policy and Procedure 1.2 - ESIP Partners and Partner Organizations**
======================================================================


**Section 1 -- Eligibility and New Partnership**
------------------------------------------------

1.1 Any entity engaged in activities pursuant to the goals and objectives of ESIP shall be eligible to join. Specifically, ESIP Partner Organizations (hereafter: ESIP Partners) will be expected to contribute substantively to the provision of improved products and services based on Earth science. ESIP Partner contributions and expertise will include, but will not necessarily be limited to, one or more of the following activities: archiving and distributing Earth data; scientific development, provision, and support of data and information products and services; and development of Earth science applications. In addition, ESIP Partners may include major financial or in-kind supporters of ESIP's activities.

1.2 New ESIP Partners may be considered for addition to ESIP types through an application to the Partnership Committee. The Partnership Committee will review the applications for completeness on a quarterly basis. Any concerns of the Partnership Committee will be sent to the applicants by the Partnership Committee Chair. Initial comments, expressed concerns, responses, and summarized comments by the Partnership Committee will be documented and available during the open review by the ESIP Assembly, and by the ESIP Board. Partnership reviewed applications will be made available to the ESIP Assembly for a one month review and comment period by ESIP staff six weeks before the next ESIP Board meeting. All comments or concerns expressed by ESIP Assembly members are to be addressed by ESIP staff with notice to the Partnership Committee. Following the Assembly comment period, the candidates shall be added to the ESIP Assembly upon receipt of approval by a majority vote of the ESIP Board.

**Section 2 -- ESIP Partner Types**
------------------------------------------------

2.1 There may be multiple types of ESIP Partners, whose defining characteristics are as described in Section 3 of this policy  (below).

2.2 Each type of ESIP Partner shall have rights and obligations defined in Section 3 of this policy (below).

2.3 New types for ESIP Partners may be defined upon recommendation of the Partnership Committee and upon receiving approval by two-thirds of the entire ESIP Assembly.

2.4 Existing Partnership types may be dropped or modified upon recommendation of the Partnership Committee and upon receiving approval by two-thirds of the entire ESIP Assembly.

**Section 3 -- ESIP Partner Types Described**
------------------------------------------------

Partner Types were created in order to organize Partners within ESIP, and a way to ensure diversity in ESIP governance on Administrative Committees.  Partner Member organizations may fit within more than one type, but are generally advised to choose a type that reflects more than half of the work done by the Partner member organization.  Partners can request a change in Type as their organization changes roles by contacting ESIP Staff.   See the list of current ESIP Partners at:  https://www.esipfed.org/partners
