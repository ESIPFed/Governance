<span class="c1"></span>

4.  <span class="c10">CORRESPONDENCE AND INTERNAL MEMORANDA</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c10">General Principle:</span><span class="c1"> Most
correspondence and internal memoranda should be retained for the same
period as the document they pertain to or support. For instance, a
letter pertaining to a particular contract would be retained as long as
the contract (7 years after expiration). It is recommended that records
that support a particular project be kept with the project and take on
the retention time of that particular project file. </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Correspondence or memoranda that do not pertain to
documents having a prescribed retention period should generally be
discarded sooner. These may be divided into two general
categories:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

2.  <span class="c35">Those pertaining to routine matters and having no
    significant, lasting consequences should be discarded
    </span><span class="c35 c46">within two years.
    </span><span class="c1">Some examples include:</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

  - <span class="c1">Routine letters and notes that require no
    acknowledgment or follow-up, such as notes of appreciation,
    congratulations, letters of transmittal, and plans for
    meetings.</span>
  - <span class="c1">Form letters that require no follow-up.</span>
  - <span class="c1">Letters of general inquiry and replies that
    complete a cycle of correspondence.</span>
  - <span class="c1">Letters or complaints requesting specific action
    that have no further value after changes are made or action taken
    (such as name or address change).</span>
  - <span class="c1">Other letters of inconsequential subject matter or
    that definitely close correspondence to which no further reference
    will be necessary.</span>
  - <span class="c1">Chronological correspondence files.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">Please note that copies of interoffice correspondence
and documents where a copy will be in the originating department file
should be read and destroyed, unless that information provides reference
to or direction to other documents and must be kept for project
traceability.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

3.  <span class="c1">Those pertaining to non-routine matters or having
    significant lasting consequences should generally be retained
    permanently.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1"></span>

5.  <span class="c10">ELECTRONIC
    </span><span class="c10">DOCUMENTS</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

1.  <span class="c10">Electronic Mail</span><span class="c35">:
    </span><span class="c1">Not all email needs to be retained,
    depending on the subject matter. </span>

<!-- end list -->

  - <span class="c1">Staff will strive to keep all but an insignificant
    minority of their e-mail related to business issues. </span>
  - <span class="c1">Staff will not store or transfer ESIP-related
    e-mail on non-work-related computers except as necessary or
    appropriate for ESIP purposes. </span>
  - <span class="c1">Staff will take care not to send
    confidential/proprietary ESIP information to outside sources.
    </span>
  - <span class="c1">Any e-mail staff deems vital to the performance of
    their job should be sent to Highrise.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

2.  <span class="c35">Electronic Documents: including Google Docs,
    Microsoft Office Suite and PDF files. Retention also depends on the
    subject matter.</span>

<!-- end list -->

  - <span class="c10">PDF documents </span><span class="c1">– The length
    of time that a PDF file should be retained should be based upon the
    content of the file and the category under the various sections of
    this policy. The maximum period that a PDF file should be retained
    is 6 years. PDF files the employee deems vital to the performance of
    his or her job should be printed and stored in the employee’s
    workspace.</span>
  - <span class="c10">Text/formatted files</span><span class="c35"> -
    Staff will conduct annual reviews of all text/formatted files (e.g.,
    Google Docs, Microsoft Word documents) and will delete all those
    they consider unnecessary or outdated. After five years, all text
    files will be deleted from the network and the staff’s
    desktop/laptop. </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">ESIP does not automatically delete electronic files
beyond the dates specified in this Policy. It is the responsibility of
all staff to adhere to the guidelines specified in this policy.</span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c51">All employees should maintain a backup of their work
computer. </span>

<span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">In certain cases a document will be maintained in both
paper and electronic form. In such cases the official document will be
the electronic document.</span>
