**1.5 Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Equal Opportunity**
===================================================================

A.  Application. This Equal Opportunity Policy applies to all of ESIP\'s
    staff, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary community members,
    to all volunteers, to all who provide contract services, and to all
    officers and directors, each of whom shall be entitled to protection
    and referred to in this document as community members.

B.  ESIP is an equal opportunity employer and complies will all
    applicable federal, state and local fair employment practice laws.
    ESIP strictly prohibits and does not tolerate discrimination against
    community members, applicants or any other covered persons because
    of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation
    (including a person's orientation toward heterosexuality,
    homosexuality, bi-sexuality or transgender status, or ESIP 's
    perception thereof), religion, age, national origin, ancestry,
    citizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed
    services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected
    under applicable federal, state or local law. All community members,
    other workers and other representatives of ESIP are prohibited from
    engaging in unlawful discrimination. This policy applies to all
    terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited,
    hiring, training, promotion, discipline, compensation, benefits and
    termination of employment.\
    \
    ESIP complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act ("ADA"), as
    amended by the ADA Amendments Act and the Colorado
    Anti-Discrimination Act. Consistent with those requirements, ESIP
    will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability
    if such an accommodation will allow the individual to perform the
    essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an
    undue hardship. If you believe you need an accommodation, refer any
    such requests to our Executive Director or a member of the Board's
    Personnel Committee. Please expressly identify your disability
    accommodations request by expressing it as a request under ESIP 's
    Disability Accommodations Policy. ESIP will also, where appropriate,
    provide reasonable accommodations for a community member's religious
    beliefs or practices.

If you are subjected to any conduct that you believe violates this
policy, you must promptly speak to, write or otherwise contact your
direct supervisor, the Executive Director, or a member of the Board's
Personnel Committee as soon as possible following the offending conduct.
If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5)
business days after reporting any incident that you perceive to be
discriminatory conduct, please immediately contact the Executive
Director or a member of the Board's Personnel Committee. These
individuals will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted. The
complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all
individuals involved and any witnesses. ESIP will directly and
thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of
perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if
appropriate.

Additionally, any manager or supervisor who observes discriminatory
conduct must report the conduct to the Executive Director or a member of
the Board's Personnel Committee so that an investigation can be made and
corrective action taken, if appropriate.

No one will be subject to, and ESIP prohibits, any form of discipline,
reprisal, intimation or retaliation for good faith reports or complaints
of incidents of discrimination of any kind, pursuing any discrimination
claim or cooperating in related investigations (See [[Whistleblower
Protection
Policy]{.underline}](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Yqlpx2MplT4D-YLNTXtKHAlg8WlgHgNqFFnZI85T140/edit#)).

ESIP is committed to enforcing this policy against all forms of
discrimination. However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends
largely on our community telling us about inappropriate conduct. If
community members feel that they or someone else may have been subjected
to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately.
If community members do not report discriminatory conduct, ESIP may not
become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able
to take appropriate corrective action.

Any community member, regardless of position or title, who ESIP
determines has subjected an individual to discrimination or retaliation
in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and
including termination of employment.

The Executive Director and Personnel Committee are responsible for the
administration of this policy. If you have any question regarding this
policy or questions about discrimination, accommodations or retaliation
that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the Executive
Director or a Board member of the Personnel Committee.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on October
17, 2017.
