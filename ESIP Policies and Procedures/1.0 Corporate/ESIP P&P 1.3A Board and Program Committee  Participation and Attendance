**Policy and Procedure 1.3A - Board and Program Committee Participation and Attendance**

1. Purpose
The purpose of this Policy is to ensure that ESIP Board and Program Committee members remain committed and engaged within the positions
they hold and to promote effective functioning and efficient communication among ESIP governance representatives.

2. Board and Program Committee Meeting Attendance
The ESIP Board and Program Committee members must attend meetings to maintain governance continuity, to be fully informed about the issues
on which they will vote, and to meet their responsibility to contribute to the decisions they are required to make.

If a Board or Program Committee member will be absent from all or part of any meeting, the Board member is expected to contact the
Board Chairperson or the Executive Director as soon as the need to be absent is known.  Board and Program Committee members are also
expected to provide updates on the workings of their respective committees to the Board Chairperson or Executive Director in a timely
fashion.

If a Board or Program Committee member is absent from three consecutive Program Committee meetings or two consecutive Board Meetings,
the ESIP President or Board Chair will ask the Board to consider removing the person from membership on the Board or Program Committee. 

Policy 1.3, Corporate Organization, Section 2, Part 5: Replacing Elected Volunteer Leaders is relevant in the event that the Board or
Program Committee member needs to be removed.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on January
14, 2019.
