**Policy and Procedure 2.4 -- Fundraising and Proposal Development**
====================================================================

> **Guiding Principles:**
>
> ESIP raises funds to sustain its operations. It does so by seeking
> funding for activities that are specific to ESIP as a member
> organization (e.g., running meetings, supporting clusters). ESIP is
> also hoping to attract funding for an endowment that would help assure
> its operations in times when other funds are not available. And ESIP
> also maintains---and will fundraise for---designated funds for certain
> activities (e.g., the Raskin Award).
>
> ESIP is a member organization and its members are also organizations.
> As such it is obliged to look to the interests of it members. All
> members of ESIP should be provided with equal access to information on
> grants, contracts or any other funding opportunities that ESIP
> discovers and/or pursues.

**A: General Rules:**

> **A-1**: Although many of its members are research organizations. ESIP
> is not primarily a research organization. The ESIP Lab is an
> opportunity to serve its members by providing shared services for
> their research. ESIP does not have a goal to become an organization
> that competes with its members for funding to do Earth science
> research. ESIP may seek funding to perform sociological research
> directed at a better understanding of how ESIP operates as an
> organization.
>
> **A-2:** Occasionally, research agencies may ask ESIP to house certain
> activities where ESIP's capabilities are appropriate (e.g., evaluating
> technology). Again, these projects are meant to leverage ESIP's
> ability as a community organization, and not to perform basic Earth
> science research. In these cases, ESIP will provide its members with
> information on how they can participate in these funded activities.
>
> **A-3:** ESIP intends to not compete with its members individually or
> collectively for funding opportunities. ESIP will announce to its
> members when it is pursuing an open call (RFP) for a funding
> opportunity. Should an ESIP member object (via an email to the ESIP
> President) to ESIP pursuing funding, this matter will be decided by a
> vote of the Program Committee, which will advise staff to pursue or
> refrain from pursuing the opportunity. ESIP can request funding from
> private foundations for ESIP community support without constraint.
>
> **A-** **4:** ESIP is not a funding organization. Some funds from ESIP
> sponsors are made available for ESIP members to do work in ESIP
> committees, working groups, clusters, and the Lab. On behalf of its
> members, and guidance from its member-volunteer leadership, ESIP will
> fundraise to support these efforts and other activities, such as
> student fellows and FUNding Friday, that help make ESIP a successful
> community organization.

**B : ESIP Letters of Support:**
================================

> **D-** **1:** Any ESIP member can request a standard letter of support
> for their proposals from ESIP even when competing with another ESIP
> member for the same grant or contract.
>
> **D-2:** To receive a letter of support from ESIP, the ESIP member
> shall articulate how the proposed work would benefit ESIP as a whole.
>
> **D-3:** The application for a letter of support (and the accompanying
> proposal) should be addressed to the ESIP President and sent to
> staff@esipfed.org.
>
> **D-4:** The ESIP member shall notify the ESIP about the results of
> the proposal selection process.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on October
17, 2017.
