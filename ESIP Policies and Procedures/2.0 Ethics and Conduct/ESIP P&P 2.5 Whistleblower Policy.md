**Policy and Procedure 2.5 - Whistleblower**
============================================

A. **Application**. This Whistleblower Protection Policy
applies to all of ESIP\'s staff, whether full-time, part-time, or
temporary employees, to all volunteers, to all who provide contract
services, and to all officers and directors, each of whom shall be
entitled to protection.

B. **Reporting Credible Information**. A protected person
shall be encouraged to report information relating to illegal practices
or violations of policies of ESIP (a "Violation") that such person in
good faith has reasonable cause to believe is credible. Information
shall be reported to the ESIP Vice-President (the "Compliance Officer"),
unless the report relates to the Compliance Officer, in which case the
report shall be made to the Finance Committee which shall be responsible
to provide an alternative procedure.

Anyone reporting a Violation must act in good faith, and have reasonable
grounds for believing that the information shared in the report
indicates that a Violation has occurred.

C. **Investigating Information**. The Compliance Officer shall
promptly investigate each such report and prepare a written report to
the Board of Directors. In connection with such investigation all
persons entitled to protection shall provide the Compliance Officer with
credible information. All actions of the Compliance Officer in receiving
and investigating the report and additional information shall endeavor
to protect the confidentiality of all persons entitled to protection.

D. **Confidentiality**

ESIP encourages anyone reporting a Violation to identify himself or
herself when making a report in order to facilitate the investigation of
the Violation. However, reports may be submitted anonymously by filling
out a "Whistleblower Reporting Form
[http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3661985/ESIP-Whistle-Blower-Complaint-Form](http://www.surveygizmo.com/s3/3661985/ESIP-Whistle-Blower-Complaint-Form)"
and submitting it to Compliance Officer electronically. Reports of
Violations or suspected Violations will be kept confidential to the
extent possible, with the understanding that confidentiality may not be
maintained where identification is required by law or in order to enable
ESIP or law enforcement to conduct an adequate investigation.

E. **Protection from Retaliation**. No person entitled to
protection shall be subjected to retaliation, intimidation, harassment,
or other adverse action for reporting information in accordance with
this Policy. Any person entitled to protection who believes that he or
she is the subject of any form of retaliation for such participation
should immediately report the same as a violation of and in accordance
with this Policy.

Any individual within ESIP who retaliates against another individual who
has reported a Violation in good faith or who, in good faith, has
cooperated in the investigation of a Violation is subject to discipline,
including termination of employment or volunteer status.

F. **Dissemination and Implementation of Policy**. This Policy
shall be disseminated in writing to all affected constituencies. ESIP
shall adopt procedures for implementation of this Policy, which may
include:

\(1) documenting reported Violations;

\(2) working with legal counsel to decide whether the reported Violation
requires review by the Compliance Officer or should be directed to
another person or department;

\(3) keeping the board of directors informed of the progress of the
investigation;

\(4) interviewing employees;

\(5) requesting and reviewing relevant documents, and/or requesting that
an auditor or counsel investigate the complaint; and

\(6) preparing a written record of the reported violation and its
disposition, to be retained for a specified period of time.

The procedures for implementation of this Policy shall include a process
for communicating with a complainant about the status of the complaint,
to the extent that the complainant's identity is disclosed, and to the
extent consistent with any privacy or confidentiality limitations.
