**Policy and Procedure 2.3 - Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) Gift Acceptance**
========================================================================================

Acceptance of any contribution, gift or grant is at the discretion of
ESIP. ESIP will not accept any gift unless it can be used or expended
consistently with the purpose and mission of ESIP.

No irrevocable gift, whether outright or life-income in character, will
be accepted if under any reasonable set of circumstances the gift would
jeopardize the donor's financial security.

ESIP will refrain from providing advice about the tax or other treatment
of gifts and will encourage donors to seek guidance from their own
professional advisors to assist them in the process of making their.

ESIP will accept donations of cash or publicly traded securities. Gifts
of in-kind services will be accepted at the discretion of ESIP.

Certain other gifts, real property, personal property, in-kind gifts,
non-liquid securities, and contributions whose sources are not
transparent or whose use is restricted in some manner, must be reviewed
by the ESIP Board prior to acceptance due to the special obligations
raised or liabilities they may pose for ESIP.

ESIP will provide acknowledgments to donors meeting IRS substantiation
requirements for property received by the charity as a gift. However,
except for gifts of cash and publicly traded securities, no value shall
be ascribed to any receipt or other form of substantiation of a gift
received by Council of Nonprofits.

ESIP will respect the intent of the donor relating to gifts for
restricted purposes and those relating to the desire to remain
anonymous. With respect to anonymous gifts, ESIP will restrict
information about the donor to only those staff members with a need to
know.

ESIP will not compensate, whether through commissions, finders' fees, or
other means, any third party for directing a gift or a donor to ESIP.
