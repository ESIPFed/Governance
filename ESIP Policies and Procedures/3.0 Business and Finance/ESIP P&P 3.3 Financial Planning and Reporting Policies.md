        ii. The Executive Director and the Board Treasurer will present
            a draft budget to the Finance Committee at least 30 days

        iii. On a quarterly basis, the Executive Director prepares a
            narrative report that summarizes the organization's current
            financial position and includes explanations for budget
            variance.
