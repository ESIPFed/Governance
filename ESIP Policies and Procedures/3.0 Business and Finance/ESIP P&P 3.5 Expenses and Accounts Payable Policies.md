**Policy and Procedure 3.5 - Expense and Accounts Payable**
===========================================================

A.  Payroll 
    --------

    a.  Policy: We pay staff members on the last day of the month. If
        the payday falls on a holiday, staff members will be paid on the
        last working day before the holiday.

    b.  Procedures:

        i.  The Executive Director processes payroll through ADP and
            monitors the relationship with ADP.

B.  Time Sheet Preparation & Approval
    ---------------------------------

    c.  Policy: All staff members must complete a timesheet for each pay
        period. All staff members should record actual hours worked plus
        all use of paid time off.

    d.  Procedures:

        ii. Employees complete timesheets and submit them to their
            supervisors on the due date, based on the schedule produced
            at the beginning of the year.

        iii. Supervisors review, correct if necessary, sign and submit
            timesheets to the Finance Manager within three (3) working
            days from the timesheet due date.

        iv. The Finance Manager is responsible for entering time sheet
            information into the accounting system monthly. All paid
            time off balances are maintained within the payroll system,
            based on the information provided on approved timesheets.

C.  Purchase & Procurement 
    -----------------------

    e.  Policy: Any expenditure in excess of \$2000 for the purchase of
        a single item should have bids from three (3) suppliers if
        possible. These bids will be reviewed by the Executive Director
        and the bid award must be specifically approved in advance by
        the Executive Director.\
        \
        Due diligence must be followed for acquisitions of goods and
        services (resources), especially for procurement of resources
        that include costs for acquisition, operation, storage,
        maintenance, safeguards, or disposal. All acquisitions should be
        approved by the Executive Director. A request for an acquisition
        must be submitted at least 10 days before the resource must be
        ordered. A comparative analysis of available resources should be
        completed prior to procurement. The procurement of resources
        that cost more than \$2000 must follow a formal bidding process
        to ensure that the resource is acquired at a competitive price.

D.  Bill Approval & Processing 
    ---------------------------

    f.  Policy: Bills may be received by postal service or email. All
        hard copy bills received are scanned and the electronic image is
        stored \[location\]. All bills must be approved by the Executive
        Director. Approved bills will normally be paid within 30 days of
        receipt or as required by the agreement/bill terms. All accounts
        payable transactions must have supporting documentation adequate
        to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are
        allocable to the grant or other cost objective (personnel,
        indirect), and comply with applicable regulations.

    g.  Procedure:

        v.  Bills will be opened, reviewed and scanned to electronic
            form by the Executive Director.

        vi. All goods and services purchased directly for a grant are
            coded to the appropriate Job Name in the accounting system.
            The bills will be marked by the Executive Director or
            designee to show job, account, and class to ensure proper
            coding of costs in the accounting system.

        vii. Bills are entered into the accounting system by the Finance
            Manager no less than monthly, and a digital copy of the
            original bill as well as supporting documentation (receipts)
            if available will be attached thereto.

        viii. Copies of all bills paid will be filed online by the
            finance department. After two years these documents will be
            archived but they will not be destroyed. See the Record
            Retention Policy for record disposition guidance.

E.  Cash Disbursement
    -----------------

    h.  Policy: Cash payments are made from the Operating Account unless
        Board approval is granted to use an alternative funding source.

    i.  Procedure:

        ix. Vendors submit a request for payment electronically via
            email. Email forwards to both Executive Director and Finance
            Manager. Executive Director reviews and approves payment,
            then assigns FOC the task of entering the bill into the
            accounting system. FOC also monitors any backlog of payment
            requests (emails) that the ED has not approved, and prompts
            ED when applicable. FOC enters the approved bill into the
            accounting system and attaches electronic copies (see Bill
            Approval & Processing section above.) ED periodically
            reviews the unpaid bills report from the accounting system,
            and pays selected bills by printing checks, signing and
            mailing.

F.  Expense Reimbursement

    j.  Policy: Staff members are reimbursed for approved travel and
        entertainment expenses. Staff members are asked to complete a
        record of all expenses for which they seek reimbursement and to
        submit receipts along with the expense record for reimbursement
        to billing@esipfed.org. Reimbursement is made via check or EFT
        within two weeks of receipt of the reimbursement request.

H.  Company Credit Cards

    k.  Policy: A credit card provides ESIP personnel with the ability
        to effectively and efficiently make purchases in relation to the
        Board of Directors approved ESIP budget.\
        Guidelines\
        1. The Board of Directors will approve the issuance of all ESIP
        credit cards.\
        2. Credit cards will be issued in the name of the employee.\
        a. Current policy authorizes one user, the ESIP Executive
        Director.\
        3. For employees other than the Executive Director, the card
        will have a credit limit of \$5,000.\
        4. The card may be used only for the purchase of goods or
        services for official business of the ESIP.\
        5. All purchases will be within current budget line item
        amounts. (See Fiscal Procedure for further details.)\
        6. The person issued the card is responsible for its protection
        and custody, and shall immediately notify the credit card
        company and Executive Director if it is lost or stolen.\
        7. The person issued the card must immediately surrender the
        card to the current Board Chair or Vice Chair when affiliation
        with ESIP has ended.\
        8. The person using a credit card for purchases that cannot be
        substantiated as a necessary purchase for official business will
        be subject to disciplinary action

    l.  Procedure: Credit card statements, along with receipts for all
        items to be paid by the ESIP, will be reconciled on a monthly
        basis by the Financial Manager and reviewed by the Executive
        Director. Receipts must show the date, purpose, and name(s) for
        which the expense was incurred. Monthly credit card statements
        will be reviewed at least quarterly by the Treasurer for
        accuracy.

I.  Expense Allocation

All cost items (labor, travel and other direct costs) which are incurred
specifically for the performance of a particular grant or similar cost
objective are direct charges provided that all like costs, incurred for
the same purpose and in similar circumstances, can also be readily and
economically identified as direct costs. Direct costs assigned to grants
include direct materials used, labor hours directly worked on the grant,
and equipment used exclusively for the grant, and goods or services
received from other entities that are directly used in completing the
grant. Cost items where (i) the allocability to specific cost objectives
is not readily measurable or (ii) are insignificant in value (example:
supplies) are charged to the applicable indirect expense pool.

Upon receipt of an executed grant or other agreement, the Finance
Manager creates a new customer/job in the accounting system. Service
items and classes may be created as needed to facilitate cost tracking
in accordance with grant requirements.

Direct expenses are all coded to the job via time entry, purchase
orders, expense reports, bill, and other means of documenting expenses.

Indirect rate allocations to government grants are calculated outside of
the accounting system by extracting cost data from the system and
entering it into an Excel rate model.

Indirect costs are costs of resources jointly or commonly used to
benefit two or more grants but not specifically identifiable with any
one grant. Typical examples of indirect costs include costs of general
administrative (G&A) services, technical support, depreciation,
insurance, security, operational and maintenance costs for buildings and
equipment, and utilities. As with direct costs, indirect costs can be
incurred internally or for goods and services received from other
entities.

All indirect costs are segregated into measurable pools of related
costs. They are accumulated by logical groupings or pools that are based
on the common relationships that they share with the business
objectives. These pools are distributed to the benefiting or generating
objectives by means of an allocation base common to all objectives which
will share in the allocation of the pooled expenses. The basic
classifications of indirect pools are fringe, indirect, and unallowable.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on October 17, 2017.
