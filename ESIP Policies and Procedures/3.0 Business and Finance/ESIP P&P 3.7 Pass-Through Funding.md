**Policy and Procedure 3.7 - Pass-Through Funding**
===================================================

A.  **Pass-Through Policy**
    -----------------------

    a.  Policy: ESIP is not equipped to serve as an umbrella non-profit
        organization. The staff and the leadership are fully engaged in
        ESIP business. Staff are not available to provide oversight for
        pass-through funding. ESIP also accepts funding from federal
        agencies and needs to comply with strict auditing rules that
        make it more difficult for ESIP to be the funding home for
        external projects, even those that are led by ESIP members.

This Policy was approved by the Board of Directors of ESIP on October
17, 2017.
