**INVESTMENT POLICY OF ESIP**

**PURPOSE OF INVESTMENT POLICY**

The purpose of this Investment Policy is to provide a clear statement of
the Organization's investment objective, to define the responsibilities
of the Board of Directors (Directors) and any other parties involved in
managing the Organization's investments, and to identify or provide
target asset allocations, permissible investments and diversification
requirements.

**INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE**

The overall investment objective of the Organization is to maximize the
return on invested assets while minimizing risk and expenses. This is
done through prudent investing and planning, as well as through the
maintenance of a diversified portfolio.

**GENERAL PROVISIONS**

-   All transactions shall be for the sole benefit of the Organization.

-   The Directors shall consider updating the Organization's investment
    policy on an annual basis.

-   The Directors shall conduct an annual review of the Organization's
    investment assets to verify the existence and marketability of the
    underlying assets or satisfy themselves that such a review has
    been conducted in connection with an independent audit (if any) of
    the Organization's financial statements.

-   Any investment that is not expressly permitted under this Policy
    must be formally reviewed and approved by the Directors.

-   The Directors will endeavor to operate the Organization's investment
    program in compliance with all applicable state, federal and local
    laws and regulations concerning management of investment assets
    \[including IRC §4944 if the Organization is classified as a
    private foundation for federal tax purposes.\]

-   Investments shall be diversified with a view to minimizing risk.

**DELEGATION OF RESPONSIBILITY; RELIANCE ON EXPERTS AND ADVISORS**

-   The Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for the
    investment and management of the Organization's investment assets.

-   The Board may delegate authority over the Organization's investments
    to a properly formed and constituted Investment Committee, being a
    Board Committee comprised only of directors.

-   The Board or Board Committee may hire outside experts as investment
    consultants or investment managers.

-   The Board may also establish an advisory committee (which may
    include non-directors) to provide investment advice to the Board
    or to the Board Committee. Advisory committees have no authority
    to act for the Board, but may monitor compliance with the
    investment policy, recommend changes, and assist the Board or
    Board Committee in selecting and retaining Investment Managers to
    execute this Investment Policy.

**Responsibilities of the BOARD, OR IF AUTHORITY IS DELEGATED, THE
Investment Committee**

-   The Board, or if authority is delegated, the Investment Committee,
    is charged with the responsibility of managing the investment
    assets of the Organization. The specific responsibilities of the
    Board or the Investment Committee, as applicable, include:

1\. Communicating the Organization's financial needs to the Investment
Managers on a timely basis.

2\. Determining the Organization's risk tolerance and investment horizon
and communicating these to the appropriate parties.

3\. Establishing reasonable and consistent investment objectives, policy
guidelines and allocations which will direct the investment of the
assets, to be reviewed by the Board on an annual basis.

4\. Prudently and diligently selecting one or more qualified investment
professionals, including investment managers(s), investment
consultant(s), and custodian(s).

5\. Regularly evaluating the performance of investment manager(s) to
assure adherence to policy guidelines and to monitor investment
objective progress.

6\. Developing and enacting proper control procedures; e.g., replacing
investment manager(s) due to a fundamental change in the investment
management process, or for failure to comply with established
guidelines.

**Responsibilities of Investment Managers**
===========================================

-   The Executive Director will serve as the investment manager.

-   The investment manager will invest assets placed in his, her or its
    care in accordance with this investment policy.

-   The investment manager must acknowledge in writing acceptance of
    responsibility as a fiduciary.

-   The investment manager will have full discretion in making all
    investment decisions for the assets placed under his, her or its
    care and management, while operating within all policies,
    guidelines, constraints, and philosophies outlined in this
    Investment Policy. Specific responsibilities of investment
    manager(s) include:

1\. Discretionary investment management, including decisions to buy,
sell, or hold individual securities, and to alter allocation within the
guidelines established in this statement.

2\. Reporting, on a timely basis, monthly investment performance results.

3\. Communicating any major changes in the economic outlook, investment
strategy, or any other factors that affect implementation of investment
process.

4\. Informing the Board, or if authority is delegated, the Investment
Committee, regarding any changes in portfolio management personnel,
ownership structure, investment philosophy, etc.

5\. Voting proxies, if requested by the Board, or if authority is
delegated, the Investment Committee, on behalf of the Organization.

6\. Administering the Organization's investments at reasonable cost,
balanced with avoiding a compromise of quality. These costs include, but
are not limited to, management and custodial fees, consulting fees,
transaction costs and other administrative costs chargeable to the
Organization.

**Endowments** **with Donor Restrictions, Information**

In 2013, a donation in the amount of \$50,000 was contributed to the
Organization for the purpose of establishing The Robert G. Raskin Memorial Fund (the
Fund) to promote collaboration, research support, and exposure for talented students in
the earth or computer sciences. The intent of the donor in making the commitment was
to establish a permanent endowment fund held by the Organization. Additional
contributions may be made to the Fund and such gifts shall be subject to the terms of the
Fund and will be considered permanent. The annual income from the Fund may be paid out
partially or in its entirety as scholarships or rolled over for use in a future year or
any combination thereof. The scholarship will be awarded annually and will provide a
stipend, travel support to the Earth Science Federation summer meeting and an invited
talk covering the winner's field of interest.

As required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America (GAAP), net assets associated with endowment funds are
classified and reported based on the existence or absence of donor-imposed restrictions. The
Organization's management has interpreted the District of Columbia Uniform Prudent
Management of Institutional Funds Act (UPMIFA) as requiring preservation of the fair
value of the original gift as of the gift date of the endowment funds, absent
explicit donor stipulations to the contrary. As a result of this interpretation, the Organization
classifies as with donor restricted net assets the original value of gifts donated to the
permanent endowment. The remaining portion of donor-restricted endowment funds are classified as
net assets without donor restrictions until those amounts are appropriated for expenditure
by the Organization in a manner consistent with the standard of prudence prescribed by
UPMIFA.

    Managers.

    10 year investment horizon shall be employed. Interim fluctuations

    contracts, leverage or letter stock.

**DIVERSIFICATION**

-   The Organization will maintain a reasonable diversification of
    investment assets between asset classes and investment categories
    at all times.

    exceed \[5%\] of the portfolio nor shall the total securities
    position (debt and equity) in any one company exceed \[10%\] of

    maintained. No more than \[25%\] of the entire portfolio may be
    invested in the securities of any one sector.

-   Investments within the investment portfolio should be readily
    marketable.

-   The investment portfolio should not be a blind pool; each investment
    must be available for review.

**ASSET ALLOCATION**

-   The asset allocation policy shall be predicated on the following
    factors:

1\. Historical performance of capital markets adjusted for the perception
of the future short and long-term capital market performance.

2\. The correlation of returns among the relevant asset classes.

3\. The perception of future economic conditions, including inflation and
interest rate assumptions.

4\. Liquidity requirements for the projected grants and other charitable
expenditures.

5\. The relationship between the current and projected assets of the
Organization and projected liabilities.

**ALLOCATION RANGE**

\[Note: The Organization should determine its own allocations, based on
its investment objectives and cash needs. The following allocation
schedule is only a sample and is not recommended for use without review
by investment counsel.\]


| Asset Allocation Range           | Target | Upper limit |
|:---------------------------------|:------:|:-----------:|
| Cash & Equivalents               | 5%     | 0 - 15%     |
| Fixed Income                     | 40%    | 20 - 60%    |
| Equities: Domestic Large Cap     | 25%    | 20 - 40%    |
| Equities: Domestic Small/Mid Cap | 20%    | 10 - 25%    |
| Equities: International          | 10%    | 5 - 15%     |

-   Rebalancing shall be done on a semi-annual basis or more frequently
    if deemed necessary.

**PERFORMANCE**

-   Performance objectives are to be met on a net of fees basis. The
    investment performance of each asset allocation class will be
    measured on two levels: against inflation objectives for the total
    Organization and against index objectives for individual portfolio
    components. Investment performance shall be measured no less than
    quarterly on a net of fees basis. Performance shall be evaluated
    on a three to five year basis to allow for market fluctuations and
    volatility.

**CONTRACTED ASSET MANAGEMENT**

-   Since the Executive Director and Board of Directors may not be
    experts in investing, an asset manager may be hired. The policy
    guidelines, diversification goals, and other details from this
    policy will be provided to the asset manager with a request that
    this policy be adhered to in the investment of the Organization's
    monies. Periodically, the contracted asset manager will be
    requested to report on the investment(s) to demonstrate compliance
    with this policy.
    
#### B.  Capital Equipment

    a.  Policy: All property that has been acquired or created by ESIP,
        which has a current value of $500.00 or more and a useful life
        greater than one year must be described in the current inventory
        of property, which must include an ESIP Property Identification
        Number (PIN). When practical, the PIN will be permanently
        affixed to the physical property or included within the
        packaging for intellectual assets. Property that does that meet
        this requirement will be expensed in the year of acquisition.
        Property that has been acquired directly for a grant will be
        expensed to the grant and will not be capitalized.

#### C.  Employee Retirement Accounts 

    a.  Policy: ESIP offers a 403(b) plan to employees held at Vanguard.
        ESIP will provide matching contribution of up to 5% of salary
        for employee contributions to a qualified retirement account
        arrangement.

    b.  Procedure:

        i. Executive Director is responsible for ERISA compliances and
            works with a third party firm.

        ii. Employee contributions are withheld from employees’ paychecks and contributions are submitted by the Operations Director each payday.

#### D.  Operating Reserve

    a.  Policy: The target minimum operating reserve fund for the
        organization is three (3) months of average operating costs. The
        calculation of average monthly operating costs includes all
        recurring, predictable expenses such as salaries and benefits,
        travel, program, and ongoing professional services.
        
        ESIP must maintain a minimum amount of available funds on
        deposit to ensure that operations can be maintained in the
        absence of funds from a current contract or award. The minimum
        amount of available funds must be equal to the total cost of 3
        months of salaries for all permanent staff members on the
        payroll and to the total cost of 3 months of other current
        overhead expenses.

    b.  Procedure:

        i.  The amount of the operating reserve will be calculated each
            year after approval of the annual budget, reported to the
            Finance Committee and Board of Directors, and included in
            regular financial reports.

        ii. The operating reserve will be funded with surplus
            unrestricted operating funds.

        iii. The Board of Directors may from time to time direct that a
            specific source of revenue be set aside for operating
            reserves. Examples may include one-time gifts or bequests,
            special grants, or special appeals.

        iv. To use the operating reserves, the Executive Director will
            submit a request to the Finance Committee. The request will
            include the analysis and determination of the use of funds
            and plans for replenishment. The organization's goal is to
            replenish the funds used within twelve (12) months to
            restore the operating reserve fund to the target minimum
            amount.

This Policy was revised by the ESIP Board of Directors on January 14, 2019.
