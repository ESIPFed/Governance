**Policy and Procedure 3.1 - Accounting**

A.  Basis of Accounting

    a.  Policy: The organization uses the accrual basis of accounting.
        The accrual basis is the method of accounting whereby revenue
        and expenses are identified with specific periods of time, such
        as a month or year, and are recorded as incurred. This method of
        recording revenue and expenses is without regard to date of
        receipt or payment of cash.

    b.  Procedure:

        i.  Throughout the fiscal year, expenses are accrued into the
            month in which they are incurred. The books are closed no
            later than the 15th of the month after the close of the
            month. Invoices received after closing the books will be
            counted as a current-month expense.

        ii. At the close of the fiscal year, this rule is not enforced.
            All expenses that should be accrued into the prior fiscal
            year, are so accrued, in order to ensure that year-end
            financial statements reflect all expenses incurred during
            the fiscal year. Year-end books are closed no later than 90
            days after the end of the fiscal year.

        iii. Revenue is always recorded in the month in which it was
            earned or pledged.

B.  Reconciliations

    a.  Policy: All bank and credit card statements will be opened and
        reviewed in a timely manner. Reconciliation and approval will
        occur within 30 days of the close of the month.

    b.  Procedures:

        i. Monthly statements are reviewed by the Finance Manager, who
            then submits them to a third party bookkeeper for
            reconciliation. The bookkeeper communicates to the Finance
            Manager any discrepancies, and reports back the results of
            the reconciliations.

C.  Security

    a.  Access to online banking and credit card accounts is restricted
        to the following:

        i.  The Executive Director

        v. External Auditor

    c.  Only the Executive Director has the authority to approve
        payments and sign checks, or perform online banking
        transactions, and any payments in excess of $5,000 must be
        approved by the ESIP President in addition to the Executive
        Director.

    d.  Only the Executive Director has administrative rights to
        internal and external accounting functions, and only the
        Executive Director can add, delete, or grant permissions to the
        list of others who have access.
