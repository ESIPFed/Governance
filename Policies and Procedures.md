Application

This Equal Opportunity Policy applies to all of ESIP's staff, whether full-time, part-time, or temporary community members, to all volunteers, to all who provide contract services, and to all officers and directors, each of whom shall be entitled to protection and referred to in this document as community members. 

ESIP is an equal opportunity employer and complies will all applicable federal, state and local fair employment practice laws.  ESIP  strictly prohibits and does not tolerate discrimination against community members, applicants or any other covered persons because of disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation (including a person’s orientation toward heterosexuality, homosexuality, bi-sexuality or transgender status, or ESIP ’s perception thereof), religion, age, national origin, ancestry, citizenship, past, current or prospective service in the uniformed services, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected under applicable federal, state or local law.  All community members, other workers and other representatives of ESIP  are prohibited from engaging in unlawful discrimination.  This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including but not limited, hiring, training, promotion, discipline, compensation, benefits and termination of employment.

ESIP  complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), as amended by the ADA Amendments Act and the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act.  Consistent with those requirements, ESIP  will reasonably accommodate qualified individuals with a disability if such an accommodation will allow the individual to perform the essential functions of the job, unless doing so would create an undue hardship.  If you believe you need an accommodation, refer any such requests to our Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee.  Please expressly identify your disability accommodations request by expressing it a request under ESIP ’s Disability Accommodations Policy.  ESIP  will also, where appropriate, provide reasonable accommodations for an community member’s religious beliefs or practices.
 
If you are subjected to any conduct that you believe violates this policy, you must promptly speak to, write or otherwise contact your direct supervisor, the Executive Director, or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee as soon as possible following the offending conduct.  If you have not received a satisfactory response within five (5) business days after reporting any incident that you perceive to be discriminatory conduct, please immediately contact the Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee.   These individuals will ensure that a prompt investigation is conducted.  The complaint should be as detailed as possible, including the names of all individuals involved and any witnesses.  ESIP  will directly and thoroughly investigate the facts and circumstances of all claims of perceived discrimination and will take prompt corrective action, if appropriate.
 
Additionally, any manager or supervisor who observes discriminatory conduct must report the conduct to the Executive Director or a member of the Board’s Personnel Committee so that an investigation can be made and corrective action taken, if appropriate.
 
No one will be subject to, and ESIP  prohibits, any form of discipline, reprisal, intimation or retaliation for good faith reports or complaints of incidents of discrimination of any kind, pursuing any discrimination claim or cooperating in related investigations (See Whistleblower Protection Policy).
 
ESIP  is committed to enforcing this policy against all forms of discrimination.  However, the effectiveness of our efforts depends largely on our community telling us about inappropriate conduct.  If community members feel that they or someone else may have been subjected to conduct that violates this policy, they should report it immediately.  If community members do not report discriminatory conduct, ESIP  may not become aware of a possible violation of this policy and may not be able to take appropriate corrective action.  
 
Any community member, regardless of position or title, who ESIP  determines has subjected an individual to discrimination or retaliation in violation of this policy will be subject to discipline, up to and including termination of employment.
 
The Executive Director and Personnel Committee are responsible for the administration of this policy.  If you have any question regarding this policy or questions about discrimination, accommodations or retaliation that are not addressed in this policy, please contact the Executive Director or a Board member of the Personnel Committee.

Each director, principal officer, member of a committee with governing board delegated powers and employee shall annually complete and file with the Company the Annual Conflict of Interest Disclosure Form, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the “Disclosure Form”), no later than July 1st of each year.  In accordance with its terms, the Disclosure Form must be amended to reflect material changes that occur during the course of the year.  The Disclosure Form shall also recite that such person:

Article VIII
Use of Outside Experts
 
When conducting the periodic reviews as provided for in Article VII, the Company may, but need not, use outside advisors. If outside experts are used, their use shall not relieve the governing board of its responsibility for ensuring periodic reviews are conducted.

### 2.3 Gift Acceptance (Cash & Non-cash)
Acceptance of any contribution, gift or grant is at the discretion of ESIP. ESIP will not accept any gift unless it can be used or expended consistently with the purpose and mission of ESIP.
No irrevocable gift, whether outright or life-income in character, will be accepted if under any reasonable set of circumstances the gift would jeopardize the donor’s financial security.
ESIP will refrain from providing advice about the tax or other treatment of gifts and will encourage donors to seek guidance from their own professional advisors to assist them in the process of making their.
ESIP will accept donations of cash or publicly traded securities. Gifts of in-kind services will be accepted at the discretion of ESIP. 
Certain other gifts, real property, personal property, in-kind gifts, non-liquid securities, and contributions whose sources are not transparent or whose use is restricted in some manner, must be reviewed prior to acceptance due to the special obligations raised or liabilities they may pose for ESIP.
ESIP will provide acknowledgments to donors meeting IRS substantiation requirements for property received by the charity as a gift. However, except for gifts of cash and publicly traded securities, no value shall be ascribed to any receipt or other form of substantiation of a gift received by Council of Nonprofits. 
ESIP will respect the intent of the donor relating to gifts for restricted purposes and those relating to the desire to remain anonymous. With respect to anonymous gifts, ESIP will restrict information about the donor to only those staff members with a need to know. 
ESIP will not compensate, whether through commissions, finders’ fees, or other means, any third party for directing a gift or a donor to ESIP.

### 2.4 Umbrella non-profit and pass-through funding
ESIP is not equipped to serve as an umbrella non-profit organization. The staff and the leadership are fully engaged in ESIP business. Staff are not available to provide oversight for pass-through funding. ESIP also accepts funding from federal agencies and needs to comply with strict auditing rules that make it more difficult for ESIP to be the funding home for external projects, even those that are led by ESIP members.

### 2.5 Proposal development
Guiding Principles:
 
All members of the Federation of Earth Science Information Partners (“Federation”) members should be provided with equal access to information on grants, contracts or any other funding opportunities that the Foundation for Earth Science (“Foundation”) discovers and/or pursues. The goal of the Foundation’s fundraising efforts is to open up  new  sources of funding and work for the Federation and its members.
 
A: General Rules:
 
A-1: The Foundation will post, on the Federation website, information about promising funding opportunities (both Foundation-generated and non- Foundation generated) that it discovers that might be of value to Federation members. The Foundation will also notify all Federation members by email when a particularly promising new funding opportunity has been posted.
 
A-2: The Foundation will post, on the Federation website,  information  about funding opportunities that the Foundation generates from other funding sources. The Foundation will also notify all Federation members by email of the opportunity and the submission procedure for proposals.
 
A-3:  All Federation members will have the right to compete individually and/or   with partners for all funding opportunities generated by the Foundation. The partners may include non-Federation members, however, the participation  of the non-Federation partner or partners should not exceed 50% of the proposed budget for the proposal.
 
A-4: The Foundation will initiate an annual planning process aimed at identifying worthy earth science information projects involving Federation members  that it will seek funding for during the coming year. The Foundation will distribute, via email and at least one month prior to the Federation’s annual Assembly meeting, an annual progress report on fund raising. The Foundation will also present its annual progress report at the Federation’s annual meeting and address questions raised by the Assembly.
 
A- 5:   All Federation members, Committees and Working Groups will have a right  to compete/contribute individually and/or with partners in the Foundation’s annual planning process via concept papers. All project concept papers approved by the Federation’s Executive Committee will be included in the Foundation’s “Strategic Funding Prospectus”. The Prospectus will form the basis for a substantial part of the Foundation’s fundraising efforts during the twelve months following its adoption. The partners may include non- Federation members, however, the participation of the non-Federation partner should not exceed 50% of the budget for the proposed project.
 
B: Foundation-Led Projects:
 
B- 1: The Foundation may identify a funding opportunity that it deems to be a candidate for a proposal from the Foundation. In these cases, the Foundation will to the maximum extent possible, solicit proposals for the completion of proposal work elements from Federation members. The Foundation will post information about all such subcontract opportunities on the Federation’s website. The Foundation will also notify all Federation members by email when a Foundation subcontract opportunity has been posted. In the interests of fairness, the Foundation will not discuss subcontract opportunities with individual Federation members  before posting the announcement. (Also see the Foundation’s Policy Manual which makes a clear distinction between the broad policy making tasks of the Foundation Board verses day to day management tasks of the Executive Director).
 
B-2: All Federation members will have the right to compete individually and/or in clusters for subcontracts in Foundation-led projects.
 
B-3: A group of members of the Federation may identify a unique funding opportunity that they deem to be a candidate for a proposal from the Foundation. In these cases, if the Foundation agrees that the funding opportunity is worthy of the Foundation’s effort, the Foundation will work with the originators of the idea to generate funding for the proposal and to implement the project. In the unlikely case of similar funding opportunities developed by distinct groups of Federation members, the Executive Director will try to negotiate an accommodation acceptable to all.
 
B-4: The Executive Director of the Foundation will determine the best team of Federation members and other participants for a Foundation-led project based upon responses to the posting of the opportunity. The Executive Director will take into account the quality of the subcontract proposals received and the goal of maximizing the participation of Federation  members in making his subcontract selections and be prepared to defend his decisions. Also see B-5 below.
 
B- 5: Any Federation member that is dissatisfied with the outcome of the subcontract selection process may request that the Federation’s  Constitution and Bylaws Committee appoint a non-interested ombudsman  to investigate the selection process. The ombudsman will not have the power to change the outcome of the subcontract selection process under investigation, but may suggest changes in the selection process for future proposals. The ombudsman will report to the Federation’s Constitution and Bylaws Committee and Executive Committee, the Foundation’s Board of Directors and the Federation member(s) that requested the investigation. Requests for such an investigation and the resulting report will become part of both the Federation’s and the Foundation’s permanent records. Such reports/requests also will be presented to the Assembly.
 
C: Funding for Foundation Operations:
 
C- 1: After consultation with the President of the Federation and the Chairs of the Federation’s Executive Committee, the Executive Director will prepare a proposed annual operating budget for the Foundation for consideration of the Foundation’s Board of Directors. Once approved, the  Executive  Director will have the authority to seek grants, contracts or other funding opportunities to finance this budget.
 
C- 2: The Foundation will charge a 10% administrative fee for  all  funding  generated by the Foundation for Federation members under the provisions of A-2 and A-4 of these Guidelines. The Foundation will charge a 15% administrative fee for all Foundation-led projects or section A-2 and A-4 projects where the Foundation provides bookkeeping and accounting services. Only one of these administrative fees will apply to any given project.
 
D: Federation Letters of Support:
 
D- 1: All Federation members have a right to have a standard letter of support for their proposals from the Federation even when competing with another Federation member for the same grant or contract. All such letters will be prepared by the Federation’s Front Office and signed by the Federation President.
 
D-2: To receive a letter of support from the Federation, the Federation member shall articulate how the proposed work would benefit the Federation as a whole.
 
D-3: The application for a letter of support (and the accompanying proposal)  should be addressed to the Federation President and sent to the  Foundation Front Office.
 
D-4: The Federation member shall notify the Federation about the results of the proposal selection process.
 
Rule Amendments
 
The Executive Committee of the Federation will monitor the implementation and continued execution of the Foundation’s fundraising program and, if necessary, recommend changes to these rules to the Board of Directors of the Foundation.

However, reports may be submitted anonymously by filling out a “Whistleblower Reporting Form” and submitting it to Compliance Officer. Reports of Violations or suspected Violations will be kept confidential to the extent possible, with the understanding that confidentiality may not be maintained where identification is required by law or in order to enable ESIP or law enforcement to conduct an adequate investigation.	
 
        	E.  Protection from Retaliation.  No person entitled to protection shall be subjected to retaliation, intimidation, harassment, or other adverse action for reporting information in accordance with this Policy.

Procedures:
The Executive Director processes payroll through ADP and monitors the relationship with ADP. 
 
 
Time Sheet Preparation & Approval
Policy: All staff members must complete a timesheet for each pay period. All staff members should record actual hours worked plus all use of paid time off.
 
Procedures:
Employees complete timesheets and submit them to their supervisors on the due date, based on the schedule produced at the beginning of the year.
Supervisors review, correct if necessary, sign and submit timesheets to the Finance Manager within three (3) working days from the timesheet due date.
The Finance Manager is responsible for entering time sheet information into the accounting system monthly. All paid time off balances are maintained within the payroll system, based on the information provided on approved timesheets.
 
Purchase & Procurement 
Policy: Any expenditure in excess of $2000XXX for the purchase of a single item should have bids from three (3) suppliers if possible. These bids will be reviewed by the Executive Director and the bid award must be specifically approved in advance by the Executive Director.   

Due diligence must be followed for acquisitions of goods and services (resources), especially for procurement of resources that include costs for acquisition, operation, storage, maintenance, safeguards, or disposal. All acquisitions should be approved by the [Responsible office, individual, or role for approval of planned acquisitions]. A request for an acquisition must be submitted at least [days needed] days before the resource must be ordered. A comparative analysis of available resources should be completed prior to procurement. The procurement of resources that cost more than $nn.nn  [Maximum cost of acquisitions that can be completed without bids] must follow a formal bidding process to ensure that the resource is acquired at a competitive price. 
 
 
BillApproval & Processing 
Policy: Bills may be received by postal service or email. All hard copy bills received are scanned and the electronic image is stored [location]. All billsmust be approved by the Executive Director. Approved bills will normally be paid within 30 days of receipt or as required by the agreement/bill terms. All accounts payable transactions must have supporting documentation adequate to demonstrate that costs claimed have been incurred, are allocable to the grant or other cost objective (personnel, indirect), and comply with applicable regulations.
Procedure: 
Bills will be opened, reviewed and scanned to electronic form by the Executive Director.
All goods and services purchased directly for a grant are coded to the appropriate Job Name in the accounting system. The bills will be marked by the Executive Director or designee to show job, account, and class to ensure proper coding of costs in the accounting system.
Bills are entered into the accounting system by the Finance Manager no less than monthly, and a digital copy of the original bill as well as supporting documentation (receipts) if available will be attached thereto.
Copies of all bills paid will be filed online by the finance department. After two years these documents will be archived but they will not be destroyed. See the Record Retention Policy for record disposition guidance.
Cash Disbursement
Questions to consider in developing Policy:
·        What kind of documentation is required from vendors (i.e. itemized invoices)?
 
Questions to consider in developing Procedures:
Cash payments are made from the Operating Account unless Board approval is granted to use an alternative funding source.
·        Are check requests required when no invoice is received?
·        Who prepares checks? Who signs them? Who mails them?
·        How are expenditure records kept?
System recently implemented is as follows:
Vendors submit a request for payment electronically via email. Email forwards to both Executive Director and Financial Operations Coordinator. Executive Director reviews and approves payment, then assigns FOC the task of entering the bill into the accounting system. FOC also monitors any backlog of payment requests (emails) that the ED has not approved, and prompts ED when applicable. FOC enters the approved bill into the accounting system and attaches electronic copies (see Bill Approval & Processing section above.) ED periodically reviews the unpaid bills report from the accounting system, and pays selected bills by printing checks, signing and mailing.


Expense Reimbursement 
Policy: Staff members are reimbursed for approved travel and entertainment expenses. Staff members are asked to complete a record of all expenses for which they seek reimbursement and to submit receipts along with the expense record for reimbursement to billing@esipfed.org. Reimbursement is made via check or EFT within two weeks of receipt of the reimbursement request.
Travel Expense - see policy 
Company Credit Cards
Policy: 
Expense Allocation 
Questions to consider in developing Policy:
·        What is the basis of cost allocation used by the organization?
·        Who is responsible for developing and maintaining the cost allocation system?
·        Who approves the system and who is involved in any changes?
 All cost items (labor, travel and other direct costs) which are incurred specifically for the performance of a particular grant or similar cost objective are direct charges provided that all like costs, incurred for the same purpose and in similar circumstances, can also be readily and economically identified as direct costs. Direct costs assigned to grants include direct materials used, labor hours directly worked on the grant, and equipment used exclusively for the grant, and goods or services received from other entities that are directly used in completing the grant. Cost items where (i) the allocability to specific cost objectives is not readily measurable or (ii) are insignificant in value (example: supplies) are charged to the applicable indirect expense pool.
Questions to consider in developing Procedures:
·        What costs are typically allocated, how are they calculated and how often is this done?
·        Who is responsible for creating and posting allocation entries and how often is this done?
Upon receipt of an executed grant or other agreement, the Finance Manager creates a new customer/job in the accounting system. Service items and classes may be created as needed to facilitate cost tracking in accordance with grant requirements.
Direct expenses are all coded to the job via time entry, purchase orders, expense reports, bill, and other means of documenting expenses.
Indirect rate allocations to government grants are calculated outside of the accounting system by extracting cost data from the system and entering it into an Excel rate model.
 
Indirect costs are costs of resources jointly or commonly used to benefit two or more grants but not specifically identifiable with any one grant.  Typical examples of indirect costs include costs of general administrative (G&A) services, technical support, depreciation, insurance, security, operational and maintenance costs for buildings and equipment, and utilities.  As with direct costs, indirect costs can be incurred internally or for goods and services received from other entities. 
 
All indirect costs are segregated into measurable pools of related costs. They are accumulated by logical groupings or pools that are based on the common relationships that they share with the business objectives. These pools are distributed to the benefiting or generating objectives by means of an allocation base common to all objectives which will share in the allocation of the pooled expenses. The basic classifications of indirect pools are fringe, indirect, and unallowable.

Policy: All property that has been acquired or created by ESIP, which has a current value of $3,000.00 or more and a useful life greater than one year must be described in the current inventory of property, which must include an ESIP Property Identification Number (PIN). When practical, the PIN will be permanently affixed to the physical property or included within the packaging for intellectual assets. Property that does that meet this requirement will be expensed in the year of acquisition. Property that has been acquired directly for a grant will be expensed to the grant and will not be capitalized.
 
Procedures:
·        How is inventory of capitalized items kept? Who has oversight?
·        What depreciation method is used and who maintains the schedules?
·        How often is depreciation posted to the general ledger and by whom?
·        What are the procedures for disposing of assets when they are no longer in use?
 
 
Employee Retirement Accounts  
Policy: ESIP offers a 403(b) plan to employees held at Vanguard. ESIP will provide matching contribution of up to 5% of salary for employee contributions to a qualified retirement account arrangement.   
Procedure: 
Executive Director is responsible for ERISA compliances and works with a third party firm. 
ADP withholds employee contribution and Executive Director makes company contributions by 3rd of the month. 



 
 
Operating Reserve 
Policy: The target minimum operating reserve fund for the organization is three (3) months of average operating costs. The calculation of average monthly operating costs includes all recurring, predictable expenses such as salaries and benefits, travel, program, and ongoing professional services.

ESIP must maintain a minimum amount of available funds on deposit to ensure that operations can be maintained in the absence of funds from a current contract or award. The minimum amount of available funds must be equal to the total cost of n months of salaries for all permanent staff members on the payroll and to the total cost of n months of other current overhead expenses. 
Procedure: 
The amount of the operating reserve will be calculated each year after approval of the annual budget, reported to the Finance Committee and Board of Directors, and included in regular financial reports.
The operating reserve will be funded with surplus unrestricted operating funds.
The Board of Directors may from time to time direct that a specific source of revenue be set aside for operating reserves. Examples may include one-time gifts or bequests, special grants, or special appeals.
To use the operating reserves, the Executive Director will submit a request to the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. The request will include the analysis and determination of the use of funds and plans for replenishment. The organization’s goal is to replenish the funds used within twelve (12) months to restore the operating reserve fund to the target minimum amount.

Operating Reserve Questions to consider:
Does the organization have a policy to maintain an operating reserve at a certain level (a specific dollar amount or months of expenses?)
Is the operating reserve available in cash maintained in a segregated bank account or investment fund or will it be commingled with the general cash and investment accounts of the organization?
Who can authorize use of this reserve and for what types of purpose?
How is the status of the operating reserve monitored and reported to the Board of Directors?

### 3.7 Funds Management
### 3.8 Operating Reserve Fund 
### 3.9 Capital Equipment Property Management
### 3.10 Umbrella non-profit and pass-through funding
ESIP is not equipped to serve as an umbrella non-profit organization. The staff and the leadership are fully engaged in ESIP business. Staff are not available to provide oversight for pass-through funding. ESIP also accepts funding from federal agencies and needs to comply with strict auditing rules that make it more difficult for ESIP to be the funding home for external projects, even those that are led by ESIP members.
 
### 3.11 Committee and Working Group Proposals and Budget Requests
The ESIP Federation makes funds available to its committees and working groups through an annual budget process (funds permitting). The following details the guiding principles and required elements for any budget request submitted to the ESIP Federation’s Finance and Appropriations Committee.
 
Guiding Principles for Committee/Working Group Budget Proposals
 
All Committees and Working Groups may submit budget proposals. A coordinated Committee or Working Group proposal request is offered by the Chair and should be supported by a majority of the members of the group.
 
The Committee or Working Group proposal request should describe how the work to be supported by the requested funds leverages and augments existing volunteer efforts by group members.
 
The Finance and Appropriations Committee will review all committee and working group proposals and respond to the committees and working groups with tentative decisions. The Executive Committee will review recommendations of the Finance and Appropriations Committee, and if it agrees with the recommendations, will initiate appropriate actions to allocate funds.
 
Committee and Working Group proposals will be evaluated on their direct long-term benefit to the ESIP Federation. Proposals should align with ESIP Federation strategic interests and should emphasize collaborations that provide long-term benefits to the ESIP community.
 
Committees and Working Groups should consider proposals that leverage collaborative activities.
 
 
Required Elements
 
Funded activities will advance one or more identified ESIP community interests, such as the following examples:
ESIP community-level technical solutions that ESIP partners can collectively develop and utilize.
Travel support to represent an ESIP entity at a professional meeting.
Short-term projects that can be sustained beyond the funded period.
 
Funded activities will align with the ESIP Federation’s strategic plan.
Budget proposals will describe how each proposed activity will meet strategic priorities.
Proposed activities will be mapped to specific strategic plan goals or objectives.
Budget proposals will rank individual funding requests as Essential, Important, or Desired.
 
Committee and Working Group budgets will be based on the deliberations of the entire Committee/Working Group, including open competition among the membership.
Notice of budget deliberations must be sent by the Committee/Working Group chair to the membership at least 14 days prior to such deliberations.
 
Funded activities and their responsible Committee or Working Group will submit required reports to the Executive Committee.
Reports will be submitted semi-annually, 30 days prior to the Winter and Summer meetings.
Reports will document milestones, money spent, and finished products,
as appropriate.
Report formats can vary, as long as the required information is provided (e.g., committee or working group wiki page, blog post).
 
Committees and Working Groups that are funded will actively participate in semi-annual meetings during the funded period. Examples of participation include Collaboration Area poster, poster during the evening reception, workshop, and demonstration.
 
Funding activities shall be consistent with the guidelines established, and/or regulations contained, in cooperative agreements and other federal funding sources, of which the Foundation for ESIP is a recipient.
 
 
General Provisions
 
Support for projects will be based on an approved fee for services and not on an hourly rate.
No overhead can be claimed on funded Committee and Working Group activities.
Unspent Committee or Working Group budget resources will revert to the general fund, at the end of the fiscal year.
Clusters do not have annual budgets. However, Clusters can submit "as needed budgets" for "special projects."
Technical innovations that have limited appeal to the broad ESIP community should be submitted to FUNding Friday competitions.
Committee and Working Group proposals should benefit the broader ESIP community and work toward a sustainable infrastructure for the ESIP Federation and its partners.
Committee and Working Group budget requests are due annually on August 1.

### 3.13 Travel and Expense Reimbursement Policy
 Travel (including registration fee) to ESIP workshops and professional meetings at which ESIP is represented by organizing a session, town hall meeting or informational activity is provided to ESIP Community members leading or supporting relevant activities.
If they so desire and have no other funding mechanism to support this, Program Committee and ESIP Board members will receive de facto support to attend the ESIP Winter and Summer Meetings. In addition, ESIP provides travel to the Student Fellows, FUNDing Friday winners according to their positions. 
 
Following submission of a Travel Authorization form (Need to develop!!) to the ESIP Office, travel by members of the ESIP Community to other meetings should be approved in advance by a majority vote of a quorum of the Finance Committee during one of its regularly scheduled meetings. Travel expenses will be reimbursed by the ESIP Office providing the appropriate travel reimbursement form is completed and submitted within 30 days of any travel being completed.  The following guidelines should be adhered to when planning travel and claiming expenses.
 
The guidelines outline standards and procedures for reducing travel costs while complying with Federal regulations for the reimbursement of ESIP-related expenses. The intent is to maintain consistency and ensure fair treatment for all members of the ESIP community whose travel will be reimbursed or paid for by the organization. That is, they apply equally to all ESIP members who receive travel support to attend ESIP workshops, professional meetings, etc.
 
Travel expenses incurred while on ESIP business will be paid for by the organization if they are reasonable, properly approved and well-documented.  As a result, approved persons who incur such expenses should neither lose nor gain funds.  All requests for ESIP-related travel should be made on the ESIP Travel Authorization form (link to doc required – when it is developed!).
 
The ESIP Office is responsible for tracking travel expenses and travel reimbursement review.
 
Actual reasonable expenses will be reimbursed subject to any limits set forth in these guidelines and approved budgeted travel limits.
 
a)     Air Travel
Expenses for commercial air travel are reimbursed on the basis of the actual cost incurred by the traveler using normally traveled routes in compliance with the ‘Fly America Act’ http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/103191, and at the most economical rate (not first or business class).  A ‘passenger receipt’ is required for reimbursement, or in the case of E-tickets, the receipt provided at the time of booking.  If a checked baggage or seat selection fee applies the receipt should also include details of these items. Except with prior agreement of the ESIP Office, change fees are not normally reimbursable.
 
b)     Rental Cars
Rental car use should be limited to situations where other means of transportation are not practical, economical or available. Travelers should choose compact or mid-sized cars whenever possible, and refill the gas tank before returning the vehicle. The traveler is responsible for collision and liability insurance.  Prior approval is required if the traveler needs to accept the rental car company’s Liability and Physical Damage coverage.  Itemized rental car receipts are required for reimbursement.
 
c)     Bus, Train,  Taxi Services
A receipt should be requested to document these expenses.
 
d)     Personal Vehicles  
The use of personal vehicles is discouraged, except for regional travel, and to and from a ‘home’ airport.  Prior approval is required for all other journeys, and such personal vehicle travel shall be reimbursed in accordance with the GSA guidelines in effect at the time of travel.
 
e)     Lodging
In the event that there is no scheduled conference or workshop hotel, travelers are encouraged to book ordinary accommodations at mid-market hotels or motels, and to take advantage of any available discounts.  Reasonable efforts should be made to obtain hotel accomodations at the location per diem limit as stated in the GSA guidelines.  Original itemized hotel receipts are required for reimbursement.
 
f)     Conference/Workshop Registration
Original receipts or proof of registration payments are required.  Prior approval must be obtained if the traveler wishes to attend optional conference field trips or events that involve costs in excess of the standard registration fee.

Prior approval is required for business meals where additional professional guests are present, and reimbursement will be made on actual cost basis.  
 
 h)     Miscellaneous Expenses
Miscellaneous expenses, such as charges for ground transportation and parking, are reimbursable upon submission of original receipts.
 
i)      Non-Reimbursable Expenses
Non-reimbursable expenses include, but are not limited to:

All requests for reimbursements of travel related expenses must be properly documented and submitted to the ESIP Office within 30 days of the travel being completed.  In the event of discrepancies in a reimbursement request (e.g., an absence of original receipts, non-matching receipted and requested amounts, etc.) the request for reimbursement will be reviewed by the ESIP Executive Director.  If a request for reimbursement is denied in full or in part, an appeal may be made to the Chair of the Finance Committee who will review the business rationale for the exception.

### A.2 Committee/Working Group/Cluster Best Practices
### A.3 Funding Friday Rules
FUNding Friday Rules (Draft, May 2017)
 
FUNding Friday is an annual mini-grant competition associated with ESIP’s Summer Meeting.
 
The mini-grants are available to ESIP members ($5000) and to students and Education Committee workshop participants ($3000), with total number of awards specified annually and generally 2-4 awards per participant group.
 
Projects are expected to be completed over the six month period between the Summer Meeting of the award and the next Winter Meeting. 
 
(FUNding Friday will be abbreviated as FF throughout this document.)
Purpose
FF promotes and supports new collaborations and novel connections between ESIP members’ projects and technologies. FF showcases how a modest amount of funding can lead to projects of real value to ESIP community members and beyond.
 
Successful projects are:
Innovative
Collaborative
Valuable to the ESIP community
 
Interested participants are encouraged to consider the meeting theme and the discussions and activities of the Summer Meeting registrants when developing a project idea. The competition does not have a single theme or topical focus. A list of awarded projects is available.
Eligibility and Participation
Eligibility
FF project leads can be ESIP members, student attendees including ESIP student fellow, and participants of the Education committee’s summer meeting workshop. Other meeting attendees are welcome as project participants.
 
Education Committee workshop participants do not need an ESIP member to sponsor them or to be a project collaborator. 
 
Students, including student fellows, do not need an ESIP member to sponsor them or be a project collaborator.
 
An eligible member can be the lead person/principal investigator on only ONE proposed project. Other project participants do not need to be ESIP members.
 
FF awardees cannot be the principal investigator of a FF project the following year or anyone receiving travel funding via ESIP, i.e. those in leadership positions. Awardees can participate on an awarded grant the next year. 
 
For group projects, each group member MUST BE listed on the poster. We strongly encourage all group members to be present during the Poster Pitch event. We also strongly encourage participants to discuss project roles and budgets during their project preparations. 
 
FF is awarded as a prize and is transferred to individuals not institutions. Those individuals will be taxed on the prize (see Tax Information for the FUNding Friday awards below). 
Federal employees may participate as project collaborators but cannot receive cash prizes or travel funding. 
ESIP members from non-federal organizations may also have organizational limitations related to accepting outside funds or using official resources for outside projects. It is the member’s responsibility to be aware of these limitations and propose projects accordingly.
How to Participate
Interested participants must exhibit a poster describing the project during the Poster Pitch session (Friday morning, check the Summer Meeting schedule for specific time and place). The poster should be hung in the provided space before the pitch session begins.
 
The poster size is limited to 25 by 30 inches. It can be hand-drawn; materials for the posters are provided to interested participants during the FF Poster event Thursday night. 
 
The lead person/principal investigator for the project must be present at the Poster Pitch session on Friday morning. This person must give a maximum 2 minute project pitch during this session. Proxies cannot provide the project pitch. Additional project participants may contribute to the project pitch. The 2 minute limit will be strictly enforced.
Awards
Awards are determined by a community vote immediately following the Poster Pitch session. 
 
You must be present at the Poster Pitch session to vote.
 
Anyone who is a registrant of the Summer Meeting, i.e. anyone with a badge, is eligible to vote. 
 
Each person attending the Poster Pitch session (Friday morning) will receive THREE member ballots and THREE student/educator ballots. You can allocate these votes across projects, eg. three votes for one project or one vote for three projects. Voting ends at the end of the Poster Pitch session. 
 
In the case of two-way tie for third place, the winners can choose (by consensus) if they prefer to split the funding and do both projects, or flip a coin to determine the winner. In the case of a three (or more) way tie, the winner of the tie will be determined by a vote of the ESIP Programming Committee at the next scheduled telecon.
 
The winners will be announced during lunch (refer to the Summer Meeting schedule for details). Participants do not need to be present at the award announcement; however, the project lead should verify that their contact information is correct with ESIP staff immediately following the Poster Pitch session if they will be unavailable for the award announcements. Likewise, participants for awarded projects should verify their contact information with ESIP staff immediately following the announcements.
 
All decisions are final.
Awarded Projects: Responsibilities and Expectations
The awards are distributed in two parts:
Half once a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), containing a statement of work, is delivered to ESIP staff at the start of the project after the Summer Meeting;
Half following the next Winter Meeting after the results of the project are presented during the poster session. All work must be completed at this time. Awardees may present their projects in a relevant session at the Winter Meeting but must present a poster.
 
Note that funding is not immediately disbursed - awardees should account for the time needed to draft the MOU and ESIP staff response. 
 
Variations in the schedule must be requested in the initial statement of work and agreed upon by ESIP staff. The payment schedule can be revised by the Executive Director in cases where there is a compelling reason to modify the standard timeline. 
 
Project groups may allocate the awarded funds within their groups as necessary to meet the project goals. ESIP is not responsible for managing those allocations.
 
All funds must be spent according to current US Government rules on contract expenditures. 
 
Overhead is not supported. 
 
Tax Information for the FUNding Friday awards 
An award is an amount received primarily in recognition of a special achievement, like winning FUNding Friday. ESIP does not specifically state how the money should be spent. Individuals accepting the cash prize will need to submit a W-9 tax form, they will be sent a 1099-Misc, Miscellaneous Income form, from ESIP and should claim this on their annual taxes. Awardees will not be able to use the 1040EZ form and may want to use their previous year’s tax rate to estimate the tax liability of the award.
